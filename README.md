Internship Project on IBM skillbuild platform by Edunet Foundation

The Challenge- A Research Agent is an AI system designed to assist with academic and scientific
research tasks. It can autonomously search for literature, summarize papers, and organize references.
Using natural language processing, it understands research questions and retrieves relevant
information.
The agent can generate reports, suggest hypotheses, and even draft sections of research papers.
It saves time by automating repetitive tasks like citation management and data extraction.
Research Agents enhance efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in both academic and industrial R&D.
Technology - Use of IBM cloud lite services /IBM Granite is mandatory.
